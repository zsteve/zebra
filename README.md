-----

Zebra is still under construction, actually, debugging stages right now!
Development is aiming for portability as far as PCs go (Mac/Unix, Windows, DOS).
Portability to slower systems (some DOS machines, etc) is probably out of 
the question, due to the fact that this is made in C++ and not all machines
have C++ compilers.

Support for Z-code story files will probably go up to v5 stories, 
without native support for pictures or sound (?)
